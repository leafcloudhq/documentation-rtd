# Kubernetes on Leafcloud

Leafcloud offers flexible Kubernetes solutions to meet your containerization needs. Whether you prefer a fully managed experience or want complete control over your cluster, we have you covered.

## Managed vs Unmanaged Kubernetes

### Managed Kubernetes (Gardener)

With our managed Kubernetes service powered by Gardener, Leafcloud manages the control plane infrastructure and provides streamlined update mechanisms. You maintain control over when updates are applied, while we handle the complexity of maintaining the control plane components.

**Benefits of Managed Kubernetes:**
- Control plane is fully managed by Leafcloud
- Easy-to-apply updates and security patches at your convenience
- High availability and reliability
- Simplified cluster lifecycle management
- Enterprise-grade Kubernetes without the operational overhead

**Best for:** Teams who want to focus on applications rather than infrastructure management, organizations requiring enterprise SLA, and those seeking hassle-free Kubernetes operations.

### Unmanaged Kubernetes (Talos, RKE2)

For teams that need full control over every aspect of their Kubernetes infrastructure, we support unmanaged Kubernetes distributions like Talos and RKE2. You manage the entire cluster including the control plane.

**Benefits of Unmanaged Kubernetes:**
- Complete control over cluster configuration
- Flexibility to customize every component
- Direct management of control plane
- Choice of Kubernetes distribution

**Best for:** Advanced users with specific requirements, teams with dedicated Kubernetes expertise, and organizations needing custom cluster configurations.

## Getting Started

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

- **[Managed Kubernetes with Gardener](../gardener/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster.md)** - Start here for a managed experience
- **[Unmanaged Kubernetes with Talos](../talos/creating-talos-cluster.md)** - For complete control with Talos

Both options run on Leafcloud's sustainable infrastructure, ensuring your Kubernetes workloads benefit from our commitment to environmental responsibility.
