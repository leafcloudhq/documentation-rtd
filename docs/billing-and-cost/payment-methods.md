2. Click **"Add Payment Method"**
3. Choose your payment type:
   - **SEPA Direct Debit** - Bank account (Europe)
   - **Credit Card** - Visa, Mastercard, etc.

Your payment method is now active for this billing contact.

## Assigning to Projects

Now assign which projects use which billing contact.

1. Go to **"Projects"** in the sidebar
2. Click on a **project** to open its details
3. Look for the **"Billing Contact"** or **"Billing Profile"** section

## Managing Multiple Projects

**Example:** You have a development project and a production project

1. Create billing contact "Development" with your company credit card
2. Create billing contact "Production" with SEPA direct debit
3. Assign dev project → Development contact
4. Assign production project → Production contact

Now each project bills separately with different payment methods.

To change or update your payment details:

1. Go to **"Profiles"** in the sidebar
2. Open the billing contact
3. Click on the payment method
4. Update the details or add a new payment method
5. Click **"Save"**

Changes take effect immediately for future invoices.
