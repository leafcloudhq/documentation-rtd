# Why Run Your Own LLM Server?

Run an LLM locally to keep your data and intellectual property entirely on your infrastructure while gaining predictable costs, low-latency responses, and full control over model choice and customization. This page answers "Why run an LLM locally?" by outlining the privacy, compliance, cost, performance, and customization benefits and pointing to practical steps to get started.

## Complete Privacy

Your code never leaves your infrastructure. Unlike cloud AI services:

- **No data sharing** - Your proprietary code isn't used to train external models
- **No third-party access** - Only your team can access the server
- **Compliance friendly** - Meet data residency and security requirements
- **IP protection** - Keep your competitive advantage secure

## Full Cost Control

You decide what you spend:

- **Predictable pricing** - Fixed hourly rate (€1.61/hr for A100), no per-token surprises
- **No usage limits** - Unlimited tokens, unlimited requests
- **Scale on demand** - Spin up when needed, shut down when not
- **Team sharing** - One server, unlimited developers

## Additional Benefits

- **Performance** - Dedicated GPU means consistent, fast responses
- **Model choice** - Run any open-source model (Qwen3-Coder, Llama, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Customization** - Fine-tune context length, add multiple models and seamless integration with existing systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Sustainability** - Leafcloud's GPUs heat buildings instead of wasting energy

## Is Setting Up a Private LLM Right for You?

Setting up a private LLM has become more approachable thanks to a growing range of open-source tools and pre-trained models. While some technical expertise is still required, the process is no longer limited to just large organizations with extensive resources.

If you're intrigued by the potential of private LLMs and have a basic understanding of relevant technologies, don't be discouraged! This guide provides a roadmap to get you started.
