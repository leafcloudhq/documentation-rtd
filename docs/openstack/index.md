# OpenStack

## What is OpenStack?

OpenStack is the world's most popular open source cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS). It allows organizations to build and manage public and private clouds, giving you complete control over your cloud infrastructure.

## Leafcloud runs on OpenStack

At Leafcloud, our sustainable cloud infrastructure is powered by OpenStack. This means you get access to enterprise-grade cloud capabilities while benefiting from our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.

### Infrastructure as Code

OpenStack's open APIs make it perfect for modern DevOps workflows. Leafcloud's OpenStack platform provides full support for:

- **Terraform** - Define and provision your entire cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files
- **Ansible** - Automate instance deployment, configuration management, and orchestration at scale

This infrastructure-as-code approach allows you to version control your infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain consistent environments across your development lifecycle.
